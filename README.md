### Deep-learning-Lab exercise
#### 1. Exploring fashion minst data (inbuilt in tf)
        1.preprocess
        2.design architecture
        3.fit the model
        4.evaluate the model
        5.plot the validation loss and accuracy
        6.predict with test dataset image
        7.predict with user given image(apply all preprocess steps and predict using  loaded model)
